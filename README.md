# CIPRDR

The ciprdr package provides functionality for the decompression and parsing
of cloud-particle images recorded with a CIP probe. So far, only greyscale
images are supported as these were the only ones I worked with.

## Example image
![Extracted particle images](doc/example.png)

## Installation

To install simply run

````
python setup.py install
````
